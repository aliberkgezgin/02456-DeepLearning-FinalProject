ABOUT THE PROJECT

Personalized news recommendation systems help users navigate the overwhelming volume of online content. Following the RecSys 2024 challenge we developed a deep learning-based recommendation model that integrates long-term user history, in-session behavior, and real-time popularity signals. Leveraging advanced embeddings, multi-head attention, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), our approach delivers relevant and diverse recommendations. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna improved performance, achieving a validation AUC of 0.9301. Incorporating diversity metrics further enhanced recommendation variety, balancing accuracy and broader content exposure. Future work aims to extend the system by employing cross-validation, using larger datasets.
